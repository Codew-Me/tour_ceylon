trip_plan_service.py — helps split the trip into days and match hotels.

Simple job:
  - figure out which city/place goes on which day
  - put all selected attractions onto those days
  - find / check hotels for each city
  - tell ai_service which hotel is for which day

Does NOT make clock times (ai_service does that).
Does NOT use OpenAI.
